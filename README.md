# CreditCardFraudDetection

Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset containing credit card transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 492 fraudulent transactions out of 284,807 total transactions. This project uses machine learning techniques to identify these fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Number of records: 284,807
Number of features: 31
Class distribution:
0: Legitimate transactions (284,315)
1: Fraudulent transactions (492)

This project primarily uses Logistic Regression for the classification of transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. 

# Test Accuracy : 95.94%

The Logistic Regression model achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions. Further improvements could be made by experimenting with other algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or even deep learning models.
